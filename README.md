# Smart Water Meter

This project is a comprehensive solution for monitoring water quality, flow, and other environmental parameters. The Smart Water Meter system integrates various sensors to measure pH levels, water flow, turbidity, soil moisture, and environmental factors like temperature and humidity. The data is sent to the cloud for real-time monitoring, with alerts provided through Telegram.

## Features
- **Water Flow Monitoring**: Measures and logs the flow rate and total volume of water used.
- **pH Level Monitoring**: Measures the pH level of water to ensure it is within a safe range.
- **Turbidity Monitoring**: Monitors water turbidity to assess water quality.
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Uses digital and analog sensors to monitor soil moisture levels.
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: Provides real-time data on environmental conditions.
- **Leak Detection**: Detects water leaks and sends alerts via Telegram.
- **Automated Control**: Controls a water pump based on sensor readings to maintain optimal water quality.
- **Cloud Integration**: Sends data to ThingSpeak for logging and analysis.
- **Remote Alerts**: Sends notifications via Telegram for important events like water leaks or abnormal sensor readings.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 or ESP8266**: Microcontroller for data processing and communication.
- **Flow Sensor**: Measures water flow rate.
- **pH Sensor**: Monitors the pH level of water.
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Assesses the clarity of water.
- **DHT22 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **Soil Moisture Sensors**: Digital and analog sensors for soil moisture detection.
- **Water Pump**: Controlled by the microcontroller to manage water flow.
- **LED**: Indicates the status of the WiFi connection.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the water pump.

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP32/ESP8266.
- **Blynk Library**: For real-time control and monitoring.
- **ThingSpeak Library**: For data logging and cloud analytics.
- **Telegram Bot API**: For sending alerts and notifications.
- **WiFi Library**: For network connectivity.

## Usage

- **Data Logging**: Access historical data and analytics on ThingSpeak.
- **Remote Alerts**: Receive notifications on Telegram for critical events like leaks or abnormal sensor readings.
- **Automated Control**: The system will automatically control the water pump based on sensor readings to maintain water quality.

## Troubleshooting
- **WiFi Connection Issues**: Ensure the SSID and password are correct and that the ESP32/ESP8266 is within range of the WiFi network.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Regularly calibrate sensors to maintain accuracy.
- **Telegram Alerts**: Verify the Bot Token and Chat ID if you are not receiving notifications.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Sensors**: Integrate more sensors for comprehensive environmental monitoring.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for better visualization and control.
- **AI Integration**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict water usage patterns and optimize water management.
